Unlimited tic-tac-toe is a 5-in-a-row version of Tic-Tac-Toe played on an infinite two-dimensional board by two players. The players seek to place 5 marks in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). The game starts by placing an X mark on the 0@0 field (the 'center' of an infinite board).

This code is a working prototype without any graphical user interface; the development is in progress. Find more detailed description under the classes and methods.
